Smart Calculator app built with Stream lit
# Smart Calculator — A Deployed Python Web Application

This project is a fully deployed **interactive calculator web application** built using Python and Streamlit.  
It was independently designed to demonstrate **software engineering fundamentals**, **secure computation**, and **real-world deployment skills**.

Unlike basic calculators, this application focuses on **safe expression evaluation**, **modular design**, and **user-focused UI/UX**.

## Why This Project Matters

Many beginner projects stop at “it works locally.”  
This project goes further by addressing:

- Secure computation (no unsafe `eval`)
- Clean separation of logic and UI
- Real-time user interaction
- Public cloud deployment

This reflects how real-world software is built and delivered.

---

## Key Features

- Accepts mathematical expressions (e.g. `2 * (3 + 5)`)
- Safely evaluates input without security risks
- Stores calculation history with timestamps
- Handles errors gracefully and explains them
- Clean, modern UI built with Streamlit
- Fully deployed and publicly accessible

---

## Technology Stack

- **Python** – core programming language
- **Streamlit** – web application framework
- **Pandas** – data handling and history management
- **NumPy** – numerical backend support
